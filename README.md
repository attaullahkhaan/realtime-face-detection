# realTimeFaceDetection

Real-Time Face detection using MATLAB system that can detect not only a human face but also eyes and upper body.
It plays an important part in many biometric, security, and surveillance systems, as well as image and video indexing systems.
This real-time face detection program is developed using MATLAB version R2012a. A graphic user interface (GUI) allows users to perform tasks interactively through controls like switches and sliders. You can easily create a GUI and run it in MATLAB or as a stand-alone application.
There are different types of algorithms used in face detection. Here, we have used the Viola-Jones algorithm for face detection using the MATLAB program.
